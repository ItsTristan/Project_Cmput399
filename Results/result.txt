# This file contains all the results so far

1) Touqir: 
	Trained with 2 hidden layered MLP network each with 800 hidden units and with 50% dropout on each of those hidden layers on the MNIST dataset.
	Ended up with a final test accuracy of 98.82%.
2) Zhaorui:
	Trained with 4 hidden layers (2 conv & 2 pooling)
	Ended up with a final test accuracy of 97.11%

3) Touqir:
	Trained with 3 hidden layered MLP network each with 800 hidden units and with 50% dropout on each of those hidden layers on the MNIST dataset.
	User 20% dropout in the input layer. Ended up with a final test accuracy of 98.72%. (Case of overfitting probably)

4) Touqir:
	Trained with 2 hidden layered MLP network each with 800 hidden units and with 65% dropout on each of those hidden layers on the MNIST dataset.
	User 20% dropout in the input layer. Ended up with a final test accuracy of 98.45%. (Case of overfitting probably)

5) Touqir:
	Trained with CNN. Test Accuracy is 99.54%. (Later I will add details about the architecture)
