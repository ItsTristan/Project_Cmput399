# This file contains the results that Touqir got so far.

1)	Trained with 2 hidden layered MLP network each with 800 hidden units and with 50% dropout on each of those hidden layers on the MNIST dataset.
	User 20% dropout in the input layer. Ended up with a final test accuracy of 98.82%.

2)	Trained with 3 hidden layered MLP network each with 800 hidden units and with 50% dropout on each of those hidden layers on the MNIST dataset.
	User 20% dropout in the input layer. Ended up with a final test accuracy of 98.72%. (Case of overfitting probably)

3)	Trained with 2 hidden layered MLP network each with 800 hidden units and with 65% dropout on each of those hidden layers on the MNIST dataset.
	User 20% dropout in the input layer. Ended up with a final test accuracy of 98.45%. (Case of overfitting probably)

4)  Trained with CNN. Test Accuracy is 99.54%. (Later I will add details about the architecture)
