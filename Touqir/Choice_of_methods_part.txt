From the late 2000s till today, deep convolutional neural networks has been the state-of-the-art method for Visual recognition tasks, achieving human level performance. This mainly motivated us to try out deep CNNs and get a feel and experience on the whole process of training, testing and evaluation with different parameter settings. We also wanted to see how its performance compares to the more conventional multilayer perceptron. The other major motivation behind choosing these two methods is that they automatically learn the features and this allows us to circumvent the tedious feature extraction phase. It has been found that usually a dropout of 0.5 works best. We wanted to find out how chaning the dropout parameter would affect the performance
