With the rise of data in todays digital era comes the high demand of data analysis with greater accuracies in prediction tasks. Unfortunately after a certain point, increasing the data samples doesn't necessarily contribute to higher prediction accuracy using classical machine learning techniques. Secondly, feature extraction needs to be performed for those methods which means domain knowledge must be used to get good accuracy. Neural Networks dont suffer from the second problem but for long taking full advantange of its general function approximation property has been hard leading to poorer accuracies than the state of the art methods of those times. With the advent of the first successfull deep learning technique[5] on 2006, training neural networks of more than 2 hidden layers became much easier which also boosted its function approximation capacity and since then they have become the state-of-the-art algorithm for many Machine Learning tasks including Visual Recognition. All of this justifies our choice of using deep neural networks for image classification. In this project we study and compare the performances of the classical multilayer perceptron (MLP)[1][2] architecture with deep convolutional neural network (CNN)[3] architecture on image Datasets. We test their performance on the classical MNIST dataset[4] with different parameter settings, such as changing dropout, network size and discuss the results.
