With the rise of data in todays digital era comes the high demand of data analysis with greater accuracies in prediction tasks. Unfortunately after a certain point, increasing the data samples doesn't necessarily contribute to higher prediction accuracy using classical machine learning techniques. Secondly, feature extraction needs to be performed for those methods which means domain knowledge must be used to get good accuracy. Neural Networks dont suffer from the second problem but for long taking full advantange of its general function approximation property has been hard leading to poorer accuracies than the state of the art methods of those times. With the advent of the first successfull deep learning technique[5] on 2006, training neural networks of more than 2 hidden layers became easier which also boosted its function approximation capacity. All of this justifies our choice of using deep learning for image classification.
